Description:
=========================
As part of the SfeduNet 2.0 project intensive, which followed the model of the NTI University 20.35, the 15P team developed the VR House project.

VR House was originally an interactive virtual reality interior configurator for new apartments. Viewing apartments in reality is fraught with many problems. Buyers often do not understand how the interior will look like in volume or do not have much time and opportunity to see the paintings live. And for pensioners and small-sized groups of the population, such an approach to sales is practically impossible. Modern technologies solve these problems and enable users to get a real-life experience.

The project was initially developed for GearVR (we simply did not have another VR helmet), and even a prototype was assembled. But the introduction of restrictions due to the global pandemic forced us to change the vector of development. Testing the project on users, the key feature of which is visibility, has become impossible in conditions of self-isolation. Therefore, our team urgently reworked the project to fit the format of a web application.

As a result, we planned to develop a SAAS product that was supposed to unite almost all players in the real estate sales market:
-------------------------- 
+ Developers: sell apartments and related works
+ Suppliers: sell furniture and materials
+ Realtors: mediation in the purchase/sale of apartments
+ Designers: sell design projects
+ Real Estate Aggregator Sites:
+ Buyers: Buy real estate, furniture, materials, design projects and pay builders to work

Our team has acquired the following skills:
-------------------------- 
+ 3D modeling and texturing
+ Building an economic model of the project, risk assessment
+ Web development
+ Development on Unreal Engine 4
+ Development for Android
+ Development for a virtual reality helmet

Control:
=========================
+ Only English layout works
+ Interaction: LMB
+ Furniture pivot: Scroll Button
+ Delete: RMB
+ Eyedropper tool: Q
+ Material selection menu: F

Outcome:
=========================
The VR House project was warmly received by the jury and other participants of the intensive. The main comment to the project was that we had not worked out the Unit economics and monetization scheme deeply enough. In the final standings, the project won a prize (3rd place out of 39 projects), and the students who were part of the team were included in the 10% of the best participants in the intensive.
